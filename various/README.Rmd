`styledtable` is an **R** package that makes it possible to export a
`data.frame` as beautifully styled **Excel** and **LaTeX** table.

> Produce tables, which you want to look at.

Have a look at the [get started vignette] to see `styledtable` in action.

## Installation

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# Install development version from GitHub
devtools::install_github('R-package/styledtable', build_opts = NULL)
```

styledtable needs certain LaTeX packages in order to support export to `tex`,
`png` and `pdf`. To install those dependencies on ubuntu, the following terminal
commands can be used:

```bash
apt install texlive-latex-extra
tlmgr install standalone
```

Windows users are advised to use binary releases of `texlive` and `tlmgr` instead.

## Concept

Transform a `data.frame` into a `StyledTable` class object. 
Use various styling functions to fine-tune the appearance of your table.
When you are finished, you can export your `StyledTable` to:

* `PDF`: Save a `PDF`-Image of your table
* `PNG`: Save a `PNG`-Image of your table
* `LaTeX`: Get the `LaTeX`-Code of your styled table, in order to include
  the code inside of an `Rnw`-File.
* `Excel`: Create a styled Excel-Worksheet inside an [xlsx]-workbook.
